Status Report: Week 8

Last week's goal:
    - Fix up report's wording and architecture diagram.
    - Update user manual on GitHub to correctly reflect the changes made.
    - Synthesize preliminary data for initial results.
    - Fix bugs and add tests.

Progress Made:
    Accomplished:
        - Changed report's wording and consistency with terms.
        - Added some tests to increase code coverage
        - Reworked Archiitecture diagram
        - Finished initial results
        - Launched to IntelliiJ Plugin Repository and attempted to fix compatability issues.

    Learned:
        - Presenting can be challenging and having a demo can take time if not executed well.
        - Working together on slides is very useful to coming up with the outline of the presentation.
        - Long proposal doesn't mean better. Need to have conciceness.

    Challenges:
        - Finding people to participate in our initial results phase.
        - Uploading to Intellij repository and supported older versions of IntelliJ

Plans:
    - Continue to revise our proposal and making it more concise.
        - Meet with Calvin to talk about maybe more specific parts that need to be strengthened.
    - Continue to solve bugs in our plugin.
    - Increase code coverage by at least 10%. (The more the better)
    - Spread the word about our plugin on forums and begin stage 2 results soon.
