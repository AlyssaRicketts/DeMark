Why:  Best practice

Code:
  1. nl2bash_server/nl2bash_server_app/views.py - Line range: [11]
  2. nl2bash_server/nl2bash_server_app/views.py - Line range: [27 - 28]
  3. nl2bash_server/nl2bash_server_app/tests.py
  4. nl2bash_server/nl2bash_server_app/urls.py

Result:
  1. It is better to keep the string style consistent. It uses request.session["seen"] with double quotes on line 11,
     but later it uses request.session['current_eng_text'] and request.session['current_bash_list'] with single quotes
     on line 54 - line 55.
     I don't know if you did that purpose, but I think there is no difference for representing strings with double or
     single quotes in python.
  2. There are several print statement through out the class. If it is part of the UI, then it's fine. If it is for
     debug purposes, then it's better to take them out of the repo.
  3. It's relatively short and not much code to review.
  4. Same as tests.py, not much code to review.
