nl2bash has 3 different projects going on at the same time. 
  - NL2BashWebScraper: Gradle project (Java). 
  - nl2bash_server: Pip project (Python).
  - tellina (forked): Python project (Python).

We probably only care about the first two which have the following 
information that we care about...

The directories are listed as "- name/". 
  If a directory has a "# file(s)" on the same line, it means that 
  we probably care about all of the files in the directory, and 
  the "#" is the number of files in that directory. 
  Only directories that we probably care about will be listed.
  
  If we only care about certain files in a directory, the it will be listed as "+ filename"
