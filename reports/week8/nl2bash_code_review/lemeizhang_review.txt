Why: Best practice

Code:
  1. add_data_from_scraper.py - line range: 22
       - Any reasons why only this comment is using triple quotation marks?

  2. add_data_from_scraper.py - line range: 40
       - The comment can be more descriptive here: what does it mean by
         "operate" on the .verify files?

  3. save_data.py - line range: 27 and 36
       - What is the purpose of these two printlns? Are they just for debugging?

  4. settings.py, urls.py, and wsgi.py
       - Just settings and configuration files, not much to review on

  General comments:
    - The comments at the beginning of each file are really helpful in
      providing a general understanding on what each of them is doing, so 
      nice job!
    - Consider breaking down the code for each file (espsecially 
      add_data_from_scraper.py and save_data) into methods for code 
      reusability?

Commits:
  General comments:
    - Some commit messages can be more discriptive. For example, the commit with
      the commit message "saving script" involves modifying several files, which
      is confusing at first for trying to understand what those modifications are
      doing. Based on my understanding of what those modifications rae doing, a
      better commit message for this can be something like "wrote scripts for
      saving test data from the web scrapper on disk"
