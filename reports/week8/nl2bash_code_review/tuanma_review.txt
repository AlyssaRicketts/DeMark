Why:  Best practice

Code: 
  1. models.py
      * Style: Delete the commeneted out lines of code from 51-53. Not sure if the the commented 
      code exists for a specific reason, but if not delete it.
      * Otherwise the code looks pretty good to me. Not much to critique in this file, everything
      was commented and it seemed decent.
  2. apps.py
      * Overall not much to evaluate, and what is there looks good.
  3. admin.py
      * Overall not much to evaluate, and what is there looks good.
