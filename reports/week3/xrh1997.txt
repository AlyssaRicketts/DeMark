4/9/2018

Last week’s goals:
 • Set up local environments (Tony, Tuan, Andrew, Jeff)
 • Project proposal (Tony, Tuan, Andrew, Jeff)
 • Get familiar with IntelliJ plugin development environment (Tony, Tuan, Andrew, Jeff)
 • Draft implementations details (algorithm, functionalities) (Tony, Tuan, Andrew, Jeff)
 • Choose plugin environment (which IDE to develop plugin for)

Progress made:
 • Accomplished:
   • Set up IntelliJ IDE and plugin development environment
   • Create a temporary plugin project and get familiar with the library
   • Finished project proposal
   • Have a draft implementation, including algorithm and data structure
 • Learned:
   • What IntelliJ plugin development requires, and how to get the environment set up
   • How to build projects with Maven and Gradle
 • Challenges:
   • First time experience with IntelliJ, so it takes some time to get familiar with how to use the software
   • It is hard to figure out every detail in the algorithm part
   • Learning plugin development for IntelliJ is difficult

Plans:
   • Think of a more detailed algorithm for each functionality
   • Create a working IntelliJ plugin that has a predictable behavior to learn how to actually develop a plugin
   • Look through the documentation of IntelliJ plugin development documentation to check what APIs are provided in the library
