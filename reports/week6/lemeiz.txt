Week 6 individual report

Goals from last week:
  - Help team members to finish implementing core functionality of the tool
  - Revise the user manual and project proposal based on feedback
  - Start writing test cases

Progress of this week:
  - Accomplished:
    - Revised user manual and project proposal based on staff feedback
    - Created a survey for recording user feedback during the experiment phase
    - Teammates finished implementing some core functionalities (Mark, Unmark,
      Clear)
    - Simple test cases are created for testing the functionalities that were 
      implemented
  - Learned:
    - Continuous Integration tool are useful for testing changes made to the
      build
  - Challenges:
    - Writing tests are hard, especially when working with a API that we just
      got familiar with not long ago
    - It is important to ensure that other people, and not just us, will 
      understand the what we are trying to say in the proposal/user manual 

Goals and plans for next week:
  - Finish implementing the rest of the core functionalities (Unclear, Display,
    and Toggle)
  - Add more simple test cases, and add complex test cases if there are time
  - Further revise the user manual and project propoal if needed
