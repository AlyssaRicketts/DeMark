Last week's goals:
    * More fixing up of writeup for project, specifcially add stronger arguments against other tools and for our tool. 
    * Discuss a tool that already exists in the writeup. 
    * Add pictures to the user manual. 

Progress made:
    Accomplished:
        * Added testing framework to project.
        * Wrote instructions on how to write tests. 
        * Fixed a few compability issues with IntelliJ built-in syntax highlighting. 
        * Fixed bug with highlighting not being deleted on unmark. 
    Learned:
        * How to do testing with the IntelliJ SDK. 
        * How some of the components of IntelliJ interact with each other implementation wise. 
        * A method on how to do persistent states in IntelliJ. 
    Challenges:
        * Implementing persistent state is going to be difficult. 
        * Lots of time needed to write comprehensive tests. 
        * Other functionalities will be difficult to implement. 
Personal plans:
        * Add more tests for implementation. 
        * Help team work on persistent state implementation. 
        * Implement other functions of plugin.
