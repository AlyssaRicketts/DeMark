Status Report: Week 7

Last week's goal:
    - Strive to finish implementation by Sunday.
    - Push plugin to intelliJ.
    - Use plugin ourselves.
        - Get friends to use and fill out survey.

Progress Made:
    Accomplished:
        - Completed implementation.
        - Plugin pushed to IntelliJ repository.
        - Made survey for plugin usage.
        - Sent out email to willing participants in survey with a distribution of plugin.

    Learned:
        - How the plugin community is being managed.
        - How to use components to perform actions on the IDEA startup.
        - Working with version compability.
        - Working with Travis and Coveralls.

    Challenges:
        - Unclear was much harder than we thought.
        - Highlighting has some few edge case issues that are difficult to resolve.
        - Not a lot of people we know on campus uses IntelliJ so first data set will be small.
        - Compability issues with older versions of IntelliJ.

Plans:
    - Fix up report's wording and architecture diagram.
    - Update user manual on GitHub to correctly reflect the changes made.
    - Synthesize preliminary data for initial results.
    - Fix bugs and add tests.
