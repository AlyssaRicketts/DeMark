        * Added more testing for the plugin. 
        * Added some code coverage support for the build. 
    Learned:
        * How to implement code coverage plugins for gradle. 
        * Some parts of how to write a persistent state component for the platform. 
        * More components of the IntelliJ platform SDK. 
    Challenges:
        * Persistent state component is surprisingly difficult to implement. 
        * Lots of tests to write for the plugin. 
        * Some components of the SDK is harder to use than others. 
        * Integrating Coveralls with Travis CI. 
Personal plans:
    * Get Coveralls to integrate with Travis CI properly. 
    * Finish implementing persistent state. 
    * Upload the plugin and use it. 
    * Get friends to use the plugin.
