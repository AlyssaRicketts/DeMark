Team DeFacto

Last weeks goals:
    Code code code
        - Meet up with other developers and flush out the details and have sort of a hackathon
    Help team find a clear motivation to our project and use cases
    Try implementing persistent state in our project.
        - Use components and lifecycle methods

Progress:
	Accomplished:
        - Made utility classes
        - Basic implementation of display
        - Revise the motivation for proposal

	Learned
        - Persistent storage is hard
        - Intellij has very few examples of persistent state

	Challenges:
        - Lots of coding
        - Read documentation that has no examples
        - Use code that only has the source code as documentation

Personal Plans:
    - Finish coding by Wednesday morning
    - Revise proposal
    - Start using plugin myself
    - launch
