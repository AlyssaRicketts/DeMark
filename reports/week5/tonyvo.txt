CSE 403 Software Engineering
Team DeFacto

Last weeks goals:
	- Start implementing ASAP
		- Play around with the classes discoverd
		- See what I can accomplished with the knowledge I have and propose that to the group.
		- Work some of the other members to have a "hackathon" day where we code and see what can be done.
		- Get basic layout of GUI finished and have a "skeleton" of the plugin so we can fill in the blanks with what is needed
	- Be a better teammate
		- Be prompt to meetings, be more vocal, voice my opinion, be cooperative and ask questions
	- Evaluate schedule and see if what we have plan is doable in the time we have left. 
		- Look over where we are at at the end of the week. 
		- Possibly tfalk to teammates about what needs to change to stay on track 

Progress:
	Accomplished: 
        - Explored and played around with the Intellij SDK
        - Worked with other developers and watched some YouTube videos to understand plugin development and read documentation
        - Looked at example plugins and looked for the functionality we wanted
        - Implemented the clear and mark drafts
	Learned
        - Playing with the API is alot better than trying to read through it.
        - Existing plugins can be used as very helpful examples
        - Designing functionality is hard especially when we have to create the spec for it and later implement it.
        
	Challenges:
        - Digging around the API can be a huge scavenger hunt when trying to figure out what we want
        - Getting the classes we want to utilize can be hard.
        - When creating the plugin and using it, there can be additions and refactors that I may want to suggest that goes against our
          current spec.
            - Mark should just toggle mark and unmark
        - Trying to split up the work between the developers and making sure everything is consistent and can connect can be hard
            - have to make sure every one is on the same page
Personal Plans:
    Finish a draft of the plugin and start using it myself
      - Find bugs, find what we may want to revise
    Work with teammates to find a better motivation behind our project and how to better portray it
      - Specific examples for use cases
      - Refining specification and use manual
    Explore the IntelliJ API more, I found a very useful method and looking at others peoples plugins is very cool.
        - Find a cool plugin
        - Look at source code
        - Browse files
        - Look at method names
        - Find useful classes / code
        - Go to official Intellij API
        - Scavenger hunt for the class I want.
        - Use autocomplete to find useful methods
