Team DeFacto

Last week's goals:
    * Get mockup GUI implemented without functionalities.
    * Organize team to work on different parts of the project so that we don't fall behind.
    * Start drafting out actual implementation plans.
    * Draft specific schedule for components.

Progress made:
    Accomplished:
        * Mockup GUI up and running. 
        * Team divided: Tony, Jeff, Tuan - development team; Andrew, Mei - write up team
        * Implementation plans completed. 
        * Rough schedule complete. 
        * Gradle up and running completely. 
        * User manual written. 
    Learned:
        * Different parts of the IntelliJ platform SDK. 
        * Other methods of keeping track of logging and temporary code. 
        * Functions of Git that pertains to patches. 
    Challenges:
        * Clarity of report is hard to achieve due to lack of understanding of other available tools. 
        * User manual apparently still incomplete, needs to be more specific with figures. 
        * Arguments against other tools still weak and needs strengthening. 

Personal plans:
    * More fixing up of writeup for project, specifcially add stronger arguments against other tools and for our tool. 
    * Discuss a tool that already exists in the writeup. 
    * Add pictures to the user manual.
