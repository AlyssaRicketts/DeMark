Week 9 individual report

Goals from last week:
  - Help preparing the slides for the presentation
  - Improve the features of the tool based on user feedback
  - Further revise the proposal and the user manual if needed

Progress of this week:
  - Accomplished:
    - Helped prepare the presentation slides
    - Helped doing code review on the assigned group (reviewed 
      nl2bash's code for the web server)
    - Addressed some known issues about the tool
  - Learned:
    - Code reviews are important for improving the documentation
      and style for code, as well as discovering flaws
  - Challenges:
    - Code reviews are nice, but it can be difficult if you are
      doing it for the first time as you don't really know what
      to look for, and whether your suggestions are good or not

Goals and plans for next week:
  - Write more tests (both simple and complex)
  - Discuss with team members about the state 2 of user trial 
    experimentation
  - Work with team members to finalize the proposal
