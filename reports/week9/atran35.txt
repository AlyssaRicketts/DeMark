      * Added a few tests for the plugin.

      * How to do presentations better. 
      * Refreshed on knowledge of JavaDocs. 

    Challenges:
      * Writing tests is difficult for plugins because of multiple 
      use cases. 
      * Finding time to work on plugin while also doing other school 
      work.

Personal plans:
    * Get next public survey up and running. 
    * Get at least one more feature implemented before public distribution.
    * Write more tests. 
    * Test distribution to see if compability issues are fixed.
