Last weeks goals:
    Try to write some tests to increase code coverage
    Try to solve some bugs listed in issues.
    Listen to user feedback

Progress:
	Accomplished:
        Fixed null pointer issues by adding checks in actions
            - Editor is null if cursor is not in the editor itself.
        Fixed non-highlighted text on file open and close
            - Added file listener on project open to rehighlight the lines
        Did a code review for NL2Bash's web scrapper

	Learned
        How listeners work in Intellij
        Don't commit straight to master, create a pull request to be reviewed.

	Challenges:
        Finding issues with a plugin and a code base can be hard.
            - Using print statements and asserts can be super helpful in debugging
              to ensure everything is what you expect it to be.
            - Static analysis can be useful. Walking through the code line by line can raise



Personal Plans:
    - Write more tests to increase code coverage
    - Talk with team mates and see if any additional features want to be added.
    - Continue using the plugin myself and if any bugs occur, post new issues.
    - Discuss stage two testing.
    - Help finalize proposal.
