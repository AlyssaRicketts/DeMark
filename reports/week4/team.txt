Status Report: Week 4 

Last week's goal:
    - Fix gradle issues. 
    - Finish architecture and design draft
    - What files we may need (classes, files, metadata) ect.
    - How does our design fit into whatâ€™s provided in the API
    - Implement first iteration of core algorithms and plugin architecture.
    - Draft user interface and design. 
    - Determine workflow, divide jobs, determine team leader. 

Progress Made:
    Accomplished:
      - Every member has finished quickstart
      - Finished the architecture and design draft.
      - Still implementing the skeleton
          - Top window has menu and each menu item corrosponds to an action
      - Finished mock up of user interface and design
      - Divided up the jobs and how we are going to approach the development process
          - Team leader: Andrew Tran
          - Tony, Tuan, Jeff are developers
          - Mei and Andrew are developers as well but also work with guiding the project. 
      - Looked through various plugin examples
          - LineOps
          - Line Highlighter
          - IdeaVim
      - Worked on User Manual for this week's assignment.
    Learned:
      - Various Classes in IntelliJ SDK
          - Document (Dealing with the document itself)
          - Editor
          - BookMark Manger
      - Looking through examples is far better than reading through documentation
          - Use documentation as supplement
      - Learned how to develop plugins in a very basic way
          - Create Actions
          - Link those actions to the xml as components

    Challenges:
      - Flushing out all edge cases of our design
          - Group decided that marked lines in a different editor should be shown
            - Only when the user clicks clear will the lines be deleted.
          - Unless cleared, marked lines will be pushed to git.
            - Our plugin helps manage temporary code, not automate deletion of it.

      - Looking through API is hard still. Trying to figure ouot the architecture behind IntelliJ SDK

Plans: 
    - Get skeleton finished by end of Sunday 4/22
    - Frequently meet and discuss our code (code review) and ensure all code push is okay with all members
        - Every commit should be addressed by all members
            - What they did 
            - Why they did it
            - What functionality does it add
    - Push towards draft before next Wednesday
    - Start thinking about experiments
        - Stage One Testing
          - Test subjects
          - Procedure plan
    - Finish user manual
        - Possibly thinking about help menu where user is able to get more information about usage.
