Status Report: Week 3

Last week's goals:
    - Set up local environments (Tony, Tuan, Andrew, Jeff).
    - Project proposal (Tony, Tuan, Andrew, Jeff).
    - Get familiar with IntelliJ plugin development environment (Tony, Tuan, Andrew, Jeff).
    - Draft implementations details (algorithm, functionalities). (Tony, Tuan, Andrew, Jeff).
        - Choose plugin environment (which IDE to develop plug in for). 

Progress made:
    Accomplished:
        - Everyone has set up the environment (Intellij install + plugin sdk)
        - Finished project proposal draft (Tony, Tuan, Andrew, Jeff).
        - Picked IntelliJ as IDE to develop for (Team choice)
        - Started the quickstart plugin development guide (Everyone)
            - Finished gradle install
        - Reviewed our specification and drafted algorithm
        - Reviewed documentation and looked around for what may be provided
    
    Learned:
        - How to start working with Gradle as a build tool. 
        - Reading through documentation is hard, especially for what we may need
        - Basic xml for plugin.xml used for gradle projects
    Challenges:
        - Finding relevant documentation that was also in depth (existing sources fairly vague).
        - Different OS’s handled the environment set up differently so setting up was especially hard
            - Ubuntu worked
            - Windows caused gradle to have errors
            - Mac couldn’t compile
Plans:
    - Fix gradle issues. 
    - Finish architecture and design draft
    - What files we may need (classes, files, metadata) ect.
    - How does our design fit into what’s provided in the API
    - Implement first iteration of core algorithms and plugin architecture.
    - Draft user interface and design. 
    - Determine workflow, divide jobs, determine team leader.
