    Learned:
        * Similar plug-ins exists, using those for reference.
        * Team coordination procedures.
        * How to write better technical papers.
    Challenges:
        * Lack of documentation on how to actually work with IntelliJ platform SDK.
        * Making sure that all team members are on the same page.
        * Scheduling conflicts and finding time to work on project.

Personal plans:
    * Get mockup GUI implemented without functionalities.
    * Organize team to work on different parts of the project so that we don't fall behind.
    * Start drafting out actual implementation plans.
    * Draft specific schedule for components.
