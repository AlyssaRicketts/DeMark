Week 4 individual report

Goals from last week:
  - Due to the fact that I just joined this team last week as my original team 
    (SAIT) was disbanded, no goals were set last week for me in this team

Progress of this week:
  - Accomplished:
    - Read through the project proposal so make sure that I am on the same page
      as other team members
    - Helped finished architecture and implementation plan
    - Read through the quick start guide for IntelliJ Platform SDK
    - Finish the first of the three presentations

  - Learned:
    - How to build a project with Gradle
    - The importance on making sure that everyone is on the same page 

  - Challenges:
    - Reading through API documentations is not an easy task, especially when I 
      don't much experience on doing it before
    - Preparing for presentations
      - need to memorize the information for a lot of slides, and need to ensure 
        that we can finish talking within the time limit

Goals and plans for next week:
  - Finish setting up the IntelliJ plugin development environment
  - Discuss with other team members about the division of work for implementation 
    (i.e. who should be doing what part), and start implementing as soon as 
    possible afterwars
  - Work with team members to finish writing the user manual
